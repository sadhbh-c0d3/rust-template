# Dockerized Rust Template

Want to start learning Rust? 

Don't know where to start?

Then this project is for you.

All you need is Docker.


First run:

```
    docker-compose up -d
```

Next run:

```
    ./enter-app.sh
```

And now you're inside Docker container with Rust installed. Happy days ðŸ˜‰

You can run this to compile some example program in Rust:

```
    cd /home/app/example
    cargo build
```

Enjoy!
